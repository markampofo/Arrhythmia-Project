These codes or scripts were produced with the aim of analyzing mathematical models of cardiac alternans to understand how easily alternans can be controlled and through which dynamical variables controls work more effectively. In particular, the codes are with respect to the Qu-Shiferaw-Weiss the Shiferaw-Sato-Karma (SSK) models which are able to reproduce both voltage and calcium driven alternans. More information can be found in the thesis titled "Control of Cardiac Alternans" produced by Mark O. Ampofo, Professor Laura M. Munoz and Professor Elizabeth M. Cherry. In addition the codes are helpful in designing control strategies using State Feedback and system properties such as controllability analysis.
