% Finite difference directional derivative
% Approximate f'(x) w
% Modified to change difference increment to values other than 1d-7.
% Modified again to take epsilon as an argument, and use relative perturbations scaled to each individual element of the 
% fixed-point vector, rather than scaling epsilon by the entire norm of the
% fixed point as in the original code. This only works 
% in cases where the selected fixed point element is sufficiently different
% from zero. To give an idea of the norm(x0)-based scaling,  norm(solem12)
% = 1.690052685089206e+002, so in the original code, epsnew=1e-7
% corresponds to a perturbation size of 1.69e-5 applied to all
% variables. I'm not sure what the default behavior should be when the
% fixed-point element is near zero; here it seems plausible to treat
% epsnew as an absolute perturbation, or as a perturbation relative to the
% norm of the fixed point vector, or as a perturbation relative to some
% "small" threshold value. The middle option doesn't make much sense to me,
% since the reasoning behind scaling the perturbations for each state element
% is that smaller fixed-point values should be perturbed by smaller amounts, 
% and using epsnew*norm(x) would revert to using the largest perturbation.
